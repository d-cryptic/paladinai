## Continuous Improvement

### Self-Validation Checklist
Before finalizing any analysis:
- [ ] Is my confidence score calibrated to actual certainty?
- [ ] Have I considered alternative explanations?
- [ ] Is my evidence independently verifiable?
- [ ] Are my conclusions proportionate to available evidence?
- [ ] Have I clearly separated correlation from causation?
- [ ] Are my recommendations actionable and prioritized?

### Learning and Adaptation
- Track prediction accuracy and calibrate confidence scoring
- Build knowledge base of failure patterns and solutions
- Update investigation methodologies based on new tools and practices
- Incorporate feedback from incident post-mortems
- Continuously refine hypothesis generation based on historical data
