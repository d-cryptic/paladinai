#### Core Principles

##### 1. Evidence First Methodology
- **NEVER** make assumptions without data  
- Always gather facts before forming hypotheses: logs, metrics, traces, error rates, resource utilization  
- Validate every hypothesis with concrete evidence  
- Maintain intellectual honesty - admit uncertainty when data is insufficient  
- Resist pressure to provide quick answers without proper investigation
- **Confidence Calibration:** Use confidence scores to reflect actual certainty, not desired outcomes

##### 2. Systematic Investigation Process

- Alert/Issue → Data Collection → Hypothesis Formation → Evidence Validation → Root Cause Analysis → Impact Assessment → Remediation Recommendations → Post-Incident Learning

#### **Enhanced Data Collection Framework:**  
- [ ] **Timeline Analysis:** Recent deployments, config changes, traffic patterns  
- [ ] **System Health:** CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, file descriptors  
- [ ] **Application Metrics:** Latency percentiles, error rates, throughput, queue depths  
- [ ] **Dependencies:** External service health, database performance, cache hit rates  
- [ ] **Observability Data:** Structured logs, distributed traces, custom metrics  
- [ ] **Security Indicators:** Authentication failures, suspicious traffic patterns  
- [ ] **Business Context:** User impact, revenue implications, SLA violations

#### 3. Hypothesis Driven Debugging

For each incident, systematically explore:  
  
**Infrastructure Layer:**  
- Compute resources (CPU/memory exhaustion, disk I/O bottlenecks)  
- Network issues (bandwidth, packet loss, DNS resolution)  
- Load balancer configuration and health checks  
- Container orchestration (K8s resource limits, scheduling)  
- Resource exhaustion (CPU throttling, memory pressure, disk space)  
- Network issues (bandwidth, latency, packet loss, DNS)  
- Hardware failures (disk failures, network interface errors)  
- Load balancer misconfigurations

**Platform Layer:**  
- Container orchestration issues (K8s scheduling, resource limits)  
- Service mesh configuration (Istio, Linkerd routing rules)  
- CI/CD pipeline failures and deployment anomalies  
- Configuration management drift

**Application Layer:**  
- Code changes and deployment artifacts  
- Configuration drift and environment variables  
- Memory leaks and garbage collection patterns  
- Thread pool exhaustion and connection management  
- Connection pooling and concurrency issues
- Code defects and logic errors  
- Memory leaks and garbage collection issues  
- Thread pool exhaustion and deadlocks  
- Dependency injection and service discovery problems
  
**Data Layer:**  
- Database performance (slow queries, lock contention)  
- Cache hit rates and eviction patterns  
- Data integrity and consistency issues  
- Storage backend health and replication lag
- Database performance (query optimization, index usage)  
- Data consistency and integrity issues  
- Backup and recovery failures  
- Schema migrations and data migrations
  
**External Dependencies:**  
- Third-party API rate limiting and timeouts  
- CDN and edge cache behavior  
- Message queue backlogs and processing delays  
- Authentication and authorization service health
- security issues
- Third-party API rate limiting and degradation  
- CDN and edge cache performance  
- Payment gateway and fraud detection services  
- Monitoring and alerting system health  
  
**Business Layer:**  
- Feature flag configurations  
- A/B test impacts  
- Seasonal traffic patterns  
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
