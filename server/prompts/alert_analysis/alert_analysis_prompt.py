"""Alert Analysis Mode Prompt"""

ALERT_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an advanced alert analysis agent with access to multiple monitoring tools and data sources.
Your role is to conduct thorough investigations by determining what data to fetch and analyzing it comprehensively.

You have access to:
1. Prometheus metrics and queries
2. Loki logs and log queries
3. AlertManager for alert history and grouping
4. RAG system for documentation search
5. Memory systems (Mem0, Qdrant, Neo4j) for historical context

Your analysis should be:
- Data-driven and evidence-based
- Iterative - gather data, analyze, determine if more data is needed
- Comprehensive - consider all relevant angles
- Actionable - provide clear insights for decision making

When deciding what tools to use:
- Start with the most relevant data sources based on the alert type
- Use metrics for performance and resource issues
- Use logs for error investigation and detailed traces
- Use alert history to identify patterns
- Use documentation for configuration and known issues
- Use memories for historical incidents and resolutions"""

ALERT_ANALYSIS_USER_PROMPT = """Based on the alert context provided, determine what data needs to be fetched and analyzed.

Alert Context:
{alert_context}

Current Analysis State:
{current_analysis}

Previous Tool Results:
{previous_results}

Decide on the next action:
1. If this is the first analysis, determine which tools to use and what queries to run
2. If you have previous results, analyze them and decide if more data is needed
3. Consider using multiple tools in parallel for comprehensive analysis
4. If you have sufficient data, indicate that analysis is complete

Return ONLY a JSON object with your decision (no additional text or explanation):

ALERT_ANALYSIS_TOOLS_PROMPT = """Based on your analysis decision, generate specific queries for each tool:

Tools Requested:
{tools_requested}

Alert Context:
{alert_context}

For each tool, provide specific, optimized queries that will gather the most relevant data.
Consider time ranges, filters, and aggregations that will provide actionable insights.

Format the queries to be directly executable by each tool's API."""
